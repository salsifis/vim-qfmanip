                                                         *qfmanip*
The qfmanip plug-in assists you in filtering and ordering your quickfix list
or your location list.

It consists of several mappings that you can customize. The default prefix for
these mappings is _q for quickfix list, and _l for location list.
See |qfmanip-mappings-customization|.

location list commands always work on the location list for the current
window.

===============================================================================
Filtering~
                                                         *qfmanip-filter*

Filtering the list is useful after a search that had too many results for
example using |:vimgrep| or |:lvimgrep|.

Four commands are provided for filtering. All commands prompt for a pattern.
If given empty pattern, the current search pattern is used.

The syntax for patterns is the same as search patterns. See |pattern| for
syntax.

 _qF : discards from the quickfix list all entries for which the buffer name
       matches the given pattern

 _qf : only retains in the quickfix list the entries for which the buffer name
       matches the given pattern

 _qP : discards from the quickfix list all entries for which the text
       matches the given pattern

 _qp : only retains in the quickfix list the entries for which the text
       matches the given pattern

With prefix _l : same with location list

===============================================================================
Sorting~
                                                         *qfmanip-sort*

_qs will sort the quickfix list (by buffer name, then by line number).

Sort is done in place: you cannot restore the previous quickfix list with
commands like |:colder|.

With prefix _l : same with location list

===============================================================================
Eliminating duplicates~
                                                         *qfmanip-duplicates*

_qu will eliminate the adjacent duplicates from the quickfix list. Moreover,
_qU performs the sort beforehand.

Elimination of duplicates is done in place: you cannot restore the previous
quickfix list with commands like |:colder|.

With prefix _l : same with location list

===============================================================================
Customization of mappings~
                                            *qfmanip-mappings-customization*

You can customize the mapping parts by setting the following variables in your
vimrc.

PART OF MAPPING                    DFLT  CORRESPONDING GLOBAL VARIABLE

Filtering buffer names (exclude)    F    g:qfmanip_hotkey_excl_filename
Filtering buffer names (retain)     f    g:qfmanip_hotkey_incl_filename
Filtering text patterns (exclude)   P    g:qfmanip_hotkey_excl_pattern
Filtering text patterns (retain)    p    g:qfmanip_hotkey_incl_pattern
Sorting                             s    g:qfmanip_hotkey_sort
Eliminating duplicates              u    g:qfmanip_hotkey_uniq
Sorting and eliminating duplicates  U    g:qfmanip_hotkey_sort_and_uniq
